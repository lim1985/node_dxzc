1
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,865
- I don't know, Jerry Lee. I don't know.
- You don't have to come, cousin.

2
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:36,161
My dad will whip me if he finds out
I went to the chocolate quarter with you.

3
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,289
- Jimmy Lee Swaggart, you're yellow.
- I am not.

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,963
- Think anybody seen us?
- Who cares?

5
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,093
Come on.

6
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,178
Come on!

7
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,381
Oh, yeah!

8
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:37,389
Come on, Jerry Lee. Let's get
outta here. It's the devil's music.

9
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,891
I can feel it.

10
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,268
Yeah.

11
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,191
Come on, Jerry Lee.

12
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,998
- Get your arms off my man.
- Hey, baby.

13
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,099
Yeah!

14
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:38,969
Hi, squirt.

15
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,973
Memphis, Tennessee
November - 1956

16
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,197
Myra, ain't it?

17
00:03:58,864 --> 00:03:59,698
Yeah.

18
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,992
- Who are you?
- I'm your daddy's cousin.

19
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,996
Jerry Lee Lewis, from Ferriday, Louisiana,
your Aunt Mamie's boy.

20
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,999
I heard about you.

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,962
- They say you're a wild one.
- When it comes to playing this here piano

22
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,882
you are looking at
the wildest mother of them all.

23
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,975
- What are you doin' around here?
- Me and your dad are forming a band.

24
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,063
I'm gonna be the main attraction. I've
got a ferocious God-given talent on me.

25
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,485
We're goin' over to Sun Records.

26
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,488
We're gonna eyeball Sam Phillips,
see if he can get us a deal.

27
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,991
- Sam Phillips discovered Elvis, you know.
- I know.

28
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,868
I got all Elvis's records.

29
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,498
Oh, Elvis ain't so hot. He can't do this.

30
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,977
You sure think a whole lot
of yourself, don't you?

31
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,395
Sure I do.

32
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,189
- Don't you?
- Me?

33
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,194
I ain't nobody. I'm only 13.

34
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,491
Well, you look all woman to Jerry Lee.

35
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,494
Myra Gale, you better behave yourself.

36
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:28,996
I am!

37
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,999
Jerry Lee here's a married man.
Ain't that right, Jerry Lee?

38
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,086
- Uh, that's not necessarily so, Lois.
- And just what do you mean by that?

39
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:41,175
Well, you see, I was still married to my
first wife when I married my second wife,

40
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,969
so I never really was married to her.

41
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,181
And since I divorced my first wife
a couple of years ago,

42
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,683
I'm as free as a bird in a tree.

43
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,271
- Well, hello.
- Hey, babe.

44
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,065
- Hey, you ready to go?
- Where?

45
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,194
- Where? Sun Records.
- What, now?

46
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,990
Hell, yeah, now. What do you think
I've been waitin' around all day for?

47
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,870
- All right.
- Daddy, can I go too?

48
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,496
Little girl, you stay home
and do your homework.

49
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:23,175
Sorry Mr Phillips couldn't be here. I'll play
those tapes for him soon as he gets back.

50
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,470
Are you sure we recorded enough, Mr
Clement? I can play anything you want.

51
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:32,392
You're good, boy, but a piano
ain't never gonna make you no money.

52
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,394
Little girls like guitar players nowadays.

53
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:41,193
They like to watch 'em wiggle around.
You can't do that behind a piano.

54
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,381
So, what did Mr Sam Phillips
think of the great Jerry Lee Lewis?

55
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:07,177
- He ain't heard him yet.
- But he will. It's a guaranteed fact.

56
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,102
Thank you, Lord, for this,
your bountiful blessing.

57
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,188
Protect and guide us
in your everlasting grace.

58
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,484
For what we are about
to receive, we give thanks.

59
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,903
- Amen.
- Amen.

60
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,864
Amen.

61
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,992
Jerry Lee, have some of my meat loaf.

62
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,203
Here you go.

63
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,167
I'm takin' the car.

64
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,004
What in holy hell is wrong with him?

65
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,300
Sam Phillips was supposed
to be back four days ago.

66
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,094
All this waitin's
drivin' poor Jerry Lee nuts.

67
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,070
- Are you ready, Mr Phillips?
- Roll it.

68
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,995
Piano, huh?

69
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,964
I can sell that.

70
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:49,488
Wait! Well, I'll be dogged. It's Mr
Sam Phillips. Come on around here.

71
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,994
We got a brand-new record
recorded today in Memphis

72
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,998
at the same cotton-pickin' studio,
by the same cotton-pickin' man

73
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,501
that discovered Elvis, Mr Sam Phillips.

74
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,004
Good old Sam of Sun Records tells me
this boy he's got is gonna be bigger

75
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,091
than the Big E, Carl Perkins
and Johnny Cash combined.

76
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,884
That's me!

77
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:16,098
The name of the song is "Crazy
Arms" and the singer is Jerry Lewis.

78
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,600
Mama! Dad! Come quick!

79
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,564
Oh, my God!

80
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:24,982
Yeah!

81
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:41,081
What do you think, Memphis? Call
Daddy-O at the Red Hot and Blue Show,

82
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:46,003
KL55656, and tell me what you think
of "Crazy Arms" by Mr Jerry Lewis.

83
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,089
We love it, Daddy-O!

84
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:51,466
Hot dog!

85
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,194
Sorry.

86
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,097
I'll take him over Elvis
any old day, Daddy-O!

87
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:58,492
Well, that vote's in,
and 39 out of 40 callers say yes

88
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,993
to "Crazy Arms" by Jerry Lewis.

89
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:03,080
Well, Myra, throw away
them Elvis records.

90
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,499
Here comes Jerry Lee Lewis.

91
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,966
What's that on your face, Officer?

92
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:21,974
Get rid of that.

93
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:26,103
Straighten up. Now, you're gonna
go and meet Sam Phillips.

94
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:31,900
Hi.

95
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,486
For Pete's sakes, Jerry.

96
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:37,197
Hi. Jay Brown and Jerry Lee Lewis
to meet Sam Phillips.

97
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:41,285
Let me do the talkin', all right?

98
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,205
Sam? JW Brown. Remember me?

99
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,499
And Jerry Lee Lewis here.

100
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,168
Mr Phillips.

101
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:57,801
You take a white right hand
and a black left hand

102
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,970
and what do you got?

103
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:04,183
Son, you got rock and roll.

104
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:10,272
Jerry, I got big plans for them hands.

105
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:14,484
Well, Mr Phillips, these hands
can heal the sick, raise the dead,

106
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,404
and make girls talk
right out of their head.

107
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:18,906
Hallelujah.

108
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,493
Jerry Lee Lewis, JW Brown,
say hello to my brother, Jud Phillips.

109
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:29,374
My brother here's got a real good feelin'
about that hot piece of wax you cats cut.

110
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,380
I'm the legman here. I move
the merchandise. And it's movin' time.

111
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,887
You gonna bust us flat in no time.

112
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,892
Sam here don't understand that you
have to spend money to make money.

113
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,977
- That makes sense.
- And Jud don't understand

114
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,481
that you cannot spend
what you do not have.

115
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,776
- You got a point there.
- And that is from the genius

116
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,403
who sold Elvis Presley for $35,000.

117
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,366
I've got bigger fish to fry.

118
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:03,992
Jerry...

119
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:10,207
how would you like to become
a member of the Sun family?

120
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:18,006
- Golly! Where do I sign?
- On the dotted line.

121
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,969
- Maybe I'd better take a look at that first.
- You're the manager?

122
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,471
Why, sure I am. Ain't that right, Jerry?

123
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,098
Uh...

124
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:31,603
Yes, Mr Phillips, he's my manager.
He's my bass player too. We're family.

125
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,985
But he won't have to read it
cos we trust you, Mr Phillips.

126
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:39,486
Oh, man!

127
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:44,992
We're gonna batter eardrums
from coast to coast, man!

128
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:48,203
- Hot dog!
- Look who's outside!

129
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,373
Elvis! Elvis!

130
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,877
Excuse me a second, boys.

131
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,006
Elvis?

132
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:02,968
How would you boys like to meet
the king of rock and roll?

133
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,470
Why, hell, yeah!

134
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,898
How you doin', son?

135
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,971
Ferriday, Louisiana
Christmas - 1956

136
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,101
Jerry!

137
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:55,979
Here you go.

138
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,487
Y'all want one? All right. Here you go.

139
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,781
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

140
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,200
- Ain't that Jimmy's car?
- It's Uncle Jimmy.

141
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:11,203
Hey! Here you go, cousin.
Take a look at that.

142
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,005
Just play it.

143
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:31,974
I'm of the opinion that a God-given talent
ought to be used for the glory of God.
I'm of the opinion that a God-given talent
ought to be for the glory of the talented.

144
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,070
Jimmy.

145
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,281
Come here.

146
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,370
How come you're actin' like this?

147
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:58,083
Boy, you got a smart mouth on you,
talkin' about God that way.

148
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:02,880
Loosen up, cousin. Now, look, I know you.

149
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:06,008
You're my blood and you're just like me
if you wouldn't fight it so hard.

150
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,803
So why don't you and me go down
to the chocolate quarter

151
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,389
and have some fun like we used to?
You remember how?

152
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,184
Now I'm going to tell you somethin'
and you listen close here.

153
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,979
God will not be mocked.

154
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,983
He speaks through those two hands
of yours, or tries to.

155
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:27,279
Your music is meant to serve him.

156
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:30,490
You were raised to preach his word.

157
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,285
Yeah, but his word is "Don't".

158
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:36,997
And I got this thing inside me
that says "Do, do, do".

159
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,583
Don't you believe in God any more?

160
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:48,300
Course I do. You know that I do.

161
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,801
Then talk to him.

162
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,679
And listen to what he has to say.

163
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,183
Read this.

164
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,980
"Narrow is the way to life everlasting. "

165
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:03,774
Other side.

166
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,403
"Broad is the road
that leadeth to destruction. "

167
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,200
- Sort of like heads or tails, ain't it?
- You keep it, Jerry Lee.

168
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:18,205
You keep it to remind you that
every day you live you have a choice

169
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,374
whether or not to serve God.

170
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,000
I will.

171
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:33,303
Choices, Jerry Lee. Talk to God.

172
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:40,978
Lord, I just wanna serve you
and I want to preach your word.

173
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,105
Hallelujah.

174
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,774
Just give me one hit record.

175
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,980
- Hey, killer.
- Hey.

176
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,274
- Take a look at that.
- Jerry!

177
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,403
Thank you.

178
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,605
Go, girl!

179
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:40,991
- Well, hello, girls.
- Come on.

180
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,578
Come on over.
A whole lotta shakin' goin' on.

181
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:53,504
Well, don't be afraid, little girls.
It's only me, Jerry Lee.

182
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:03,680
Don't you like it?

183
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:06,475
My mama don't want me
listening to rock and roll.

184
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,602
She says it leads to impure thoughts.

185
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,570
Her mama's right.

186
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,906
It is the devil's music.

187
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,079
Yeah.

188
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:59,111
- Hey, buddy, where you going?
- I'm with the band. I'm with the band.

189
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:02,573
-Hey
-Hey, I'm with the band

190
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,784
- There's a queue.
- Come on, little lady. Get off him here.

191
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,597
What you gonna do about it?
Take your bald head and get out.

192
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:27,806
Let go!

193
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,404
Jerry. Jerry!

194
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:46,575
I've had it. I'm goin' back
to my job at the electric company.

195
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,994
You can't. We're gonna
cut another record soon.

196
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,079
"Crazy Arms" didn't make us
a nickel, man.

197
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:54,082
I got four mouths to feed.
Your big mouth is five.

198
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,293
Jay, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

199
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:59,171
We're gonna be partners.
Fifty-fifty. What do you say?

200
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:03,175
What's 50 per cent of nothin', man?
Look at these people.

201
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:07,471
Right, that does it.

202
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:25,489
- Let's do that "Shakin"' song.
- We can't play that nigger music in here.

203
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:29,284
These rednecks might lynch us.
Are you crazy?

204
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:31,078
Yeah.

205
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,204
Fifty-fifty, right?

206
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:54,203
Now real low.

207
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:00,000
All you got to do, honey, is just stand it...

208
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:05,672
right in one tight, little, sweet, little spot...

209
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,592
and then wiggle it around

210
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:13,889
just a little-ittle-ittle-ittle-ittle-ittle-ittle-
ittle-ittle-ittle-ittle-ittle-ittle-ittle-ittle bit.

211
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:22,397
And that's when you flat-out smack-dab
have got something, you know?

212
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:23,899
Let's go!

213
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:50,175
"Whole Lotta Shakin"' is bein' banned
by radio stations all over the South.

214
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:54,513
Now the preachers are
getting involved in the act.

215
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,391
Don't get your head turned
by a bunch of Bible-thumpers.

216
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,395
Give me some money. I'd take 'em
to New York. I'd put 'em on national TV.

217
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:04,189
- Why throw good money after bad?
- If you don't, you'll lose him

218
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,191
like you lost Elvis.

219
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:10,487
All right,
take the son of a bitch to New York.

220
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,512
Jerry Lee Lewis!

221
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:10,274
- Is that for me?
- Yes.

222
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,499
Get out the cheque.

223
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:32,087
- Well, sign it.
- It's a small fortune.

224
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:35,674
I know, but it's a quarter
of what we'll owe him. Now sign it.

225
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:36,800
It's great publicity.

226
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:41,889
Hi.

227
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:47,186
- Well, hello, doll.
- Excuse me, little lady. This way, Jerry.

228
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,108
Stand back. Give the boy air here.

229
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:58,405
Now, good people, since Jerry here
appeared on the Steve Allen Show,

230
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:03,994
"Whole Lotta Shakin"'
has sold 200,000 copies,

231
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,997
has hit number ten on the pop charts,

232
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:11,084
and is zooming higher every day.

233
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,379
Everybody is goin' crazy
for his pumpin' piano sound.

234
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:17,883
Why, this boy can make
a horse stop and listen.

235
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:21,595
He is an action artist.

236
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:29,102
Jerry, I'd like to present you with this,
your first royalty cheque.

237
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:38,278
There's more zeroes here than
there was Fs on my third-grade report.

238
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:42,407
Is that $4,000?

239
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:45,285
- No, cousin. That's $40,000.
- $40,000!

240
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,206
Fifty-fifty, remember?

241
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,294
Some religious people take exception
to the suggestiveness of your song

242
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,088
and its savage animal rhythms.

243
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,591
Well, I... It just comes out that way
naturally. I can't help it.

244
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,594
Hasn't your song been banned
by several radio stations?

245
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:06,682
- They say it's against God.
- Well, I don't understand that.

246
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:12,896
I serve him gladly. I sing. I shout. It's not
my fault I don't play like some old lady.

247
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:16,483
Amen, Brother Lewis. Amen. Come on,
let's go and get these bags here.

248
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:19,486
Any plans for sellin' Lewis
to a major label like Elvis?

249
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:20,696
Hell, no.

250
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:23,615
Jerry Lee Lewis is gonna
be bigger than Elvis.

251
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,911
See that look in his eye?

252
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:31,999
That boy could get himself,
and us, in a whole lotta trouble.

253
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:36,795
Oh, hell. He may be a little wild,
but he's a good old boy.

254
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:39,298
He's been stayin' at your place, hasn't he?

255
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,675
Well, yeah.

256
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:45,012
- But it's awful crowded.
- Look, Jay, it's like this.

257
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,307
If Casanova over there can live with you,

258
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:52,311
you can keep an eye on him,
keep him out of trouble.

259
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:55,981
Keep those cheques rolling in.

260
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:02,613
All right. I guess we could
scooch things around a little.

261
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:06,783
Well, that's fine, Jay, fine.

262
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:20,088
There's the big man. Oop!
Freight train comin' through.

263
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:27,596
I really do appreciate you folks takin' me
in like this. I... I really do, Jay.

264
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,806
Well, shoot, cousin.
We're glad to have you here.

265
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:36,396
Well, it just goes to show you
how important family really is.

266
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:39,399
Sure is better than that old couch.

267
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,486
Well, you just make yourself
right at home here, cousin.

268
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:45,489
Thank you, Lois. Thank you very much.

269
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:52,579
I forgot something.

270
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:55,499
Hey.

271
00:31:57,793 --> 00:31:59,086
What say you and me take a drive
down to the Kreme Kup?

272
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:04,800
- OK.
- I'm takin' the car.

273
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:24,987
It's Jerry Lee Lewis!

274
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:27,990
What? Hello, girls.

275
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:30,617
- Can I get a couple of cones?
- Oh, cones, cones, cones.

276
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:32,995
No dip.

277
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,294
Nice dry-cleaned uniforms y'all got there.

278
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:48,594
- What's your name?
- Missy.

279
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:50,596
Missy. That's a very nice name.

280
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:54,016
- That'll be 20 cents.
- You think you could take it out of this?

281
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,479
$40,000?!

282
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:05,611
- We don't have that kind of change.
- Gosh, I'm sorry. That's all I've got.

283
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:06,695
I got a dollar.

284
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:09,198
Oh, it's on the house.

285
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:11,992
Well, thank you very much.

286
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:14,995
You can get free custard here
any time you want!

287
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:38,310
I saw this thing at school.
They had this movie about the H-bomb.

288
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:44,191
You know, the hydrogen bomb. About it
comin' and blowin' up the whole world.

289
00:33:44,483 --> 00:33:49,404
Oh, that's the Apocalypse.
That's in Revelations in your Bible.

290
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:55,494
You know, I go on fine all day at school.

291
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:01,416
And then at night, when I lay down,

292
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,877
I think to myself...

293
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:07,798
"Is this the night
the bomb's gonna come?"

294
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:16,515
All I ever wanted was a little
pink house with a blue door.

295
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:20,102
A little baby sittin' in a highchair.

296
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:28,318
Who do you see comin' up the walk
of that pink house? Hm?

297
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:34,283
I don't know.

298
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,201
You don't know?

299
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:40,706
Well?

300
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:43,584
Do you think he might be about,
oh, six foot tall,

301
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:49,298
with big blue eyes
and wavy, curly blond hair?

302
00:35:08,984 --> 00:35:09,902
What?

303
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:12,905
Now maybe I won't have anything.

304
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:16,116
This old horrible bomb's
gonna come and wipe it all away.

305
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,992
Uh-uh.

306
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:24,208
Everything'll be destroyed,
and this is as far as I'll ever get in life.

307
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,793
Mm-mm.

308
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:31,715
I don't even know what hydrogen is.

309
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:05,290
And 1,000 makes $40,000.

310
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:06,792
Sh!

311
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:55,090
Hi!

312
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:57,885
Hallelujah!

313
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,804
Hallelujah!

314
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:04,183
I had my car break down once
on the side of the road.

315
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:07,311
And I got out and I laid hands
on the hood of this car

316
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,398
and I said "Devil, if you think I've been
crazy before, you just wait one minute

317
00:37:11,607 --> 00:37:16,778
because I'm going to ask the Lord
to come down and heal this Plymouth. "

318
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:18,697
- Amen.
- Hallelujah.

319
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,618
So I got down and I asked the Holy Spirit
to make her whole again

320
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:28,081
and the Holy Spirit, lo and behold,
came down and made her good as new.

321
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,419
Glory, hallelujah, praise God, brother.

322
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:37,591
Well, this here is
my cousin, Jerry Lee Lewis.

323
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:41,386
Y'all probably know him from that
blasphemous "Shakin"' song he put out.

324
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:44,806
Number four in the top ten
this week, cousin.

325
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:46,808
Well, I really doubt
that it's in the Lord's top ten.

326
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,019
Rock and roll is the devil's music.

327
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:50,604
- Right.
- That's right.

328
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:54,107
Rock and roll is a rhythm. A feelin'.

329
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:57,611
A feeling that emanates
from the pit of hell.

330
00:37:57,903 --> 00:38:01,114
- Right.
- Well, that feeling got me a hit record.

331
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,619
A hit record.

332
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,416
Do you still have that coin
I gave to you onetime?

333
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,586
Oh, as a matter of fact...

334
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:15,796
I do.

335
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,590
Choices, Jerry Lee.

336
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:21,593
This whole life is all about choices.

337
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:26,098
What choice are you going to make
with your music? With your life?

338
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:31,103
I don't play or sing as well as you do.

339
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:32,688
I heard that.

340
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:37,818
But all that I have belongs to God. All of it.

341
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:41,405
What would happen
if you gave him all you have?

342
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:47,494
Well, as a matter of fact, cousin,
I just might do that one day.

343
00:38:47,786 --> 00:38:48,495
Praise God.

344
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,206
- What about today?
- What?

345
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:55,919
Do you remember what you said
you would do if you got a hit record?

346
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,797
You said you would go out
and preach his word.

347
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,007
Did I say that?

348
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,386
That's funny. I don't remember
sayin' that. I must have been drunk.

349
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:07,890
But the Lord remembers, cousin.

350
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:11,894
Well, is this that car
that God healed for you?

351
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:15,189
Well, that was six months ago.
She's up and died on me now.

352
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:17,608
Why don't you just lay hands on her here?

353
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:20,110
- I'd like to see that myself.
- Cousin, you cannot ask the Lord

354
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:24,698
for more help than you are willing
to help yourself. He's got me this far...

355
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:28,911
Why don't you just let this old Oldsmobile
here get you a little further along?

356
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:34,708
You made a choice just then, Jerry Lee.

357
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,212
From your singin' came this car,

358
00:39:38,504 --> 00:39:42,591
and from this car will come
the spreading of God's word.

359
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:43,800
Amen.

360
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,387
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Well, don't thank Jesus.

361
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:48,889
Thank Jerry Lee Lewis.

362
00:39:53,101 --> 00:39:55,020
Praise God, cousin.

363
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:40,607
- Let's go to bed, babe.
- OK.

364
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,321
Bedtime, Myra Gale.

365
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:49,783
Let them watch their movie.

366
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:07,009
Well, what do you think?

367
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:10,220
You know, Jay,

368
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:14,183
I reckon hooking up with Jerry Lee is
about the best thing ever happened to us.

369
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:20,689
Look here what I'm gonna buy next.

370
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:24,485
"The kitchen of tomorrow, today. "

371
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:31,116
- What in the hell are they doin' in there?
- Would you just leave them alone?

372
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:34,786
They're just watchin' TV.

373
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:46,089
That boy's been deep-fried.

374
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,012
It's only a movie.

375
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:54,097
Just a movie.

376
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:58,519
Here comes the creepy mouse.

377
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,522
Here comes the creepy mouse.

378
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:32,589
Mr Freed, Jerry Lee Lewis can blow
Chuck Berry right off of that stage.

379
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:34,591
Why do I have to go on before him?

380
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:37,094
He's had six number one hits
and you've only had two in the top ten.

381
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:41,723
- Who's got the number one record now?
- You.

382
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,893
- My point exactly.
- He should go on before me.

383
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:50,190
He can't. It's in his contract
that he closes the show.

384
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:59,616
OK, cat. If that's the way you want it.

385
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,301
Follow that, killer.

386
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:05,409
Come here, Romeo.
Let's get you in the car.

387
00:47:06,118 --> 00:47:06,994
Drive.

388
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:17,921
Ooh, I want you to play me
like you play that piano, hot stuff.

389
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:41,111
Hey!

390
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:44,198
Hey!

391
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:46,825
Hey, you see that... that... Hey!

392
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:52,289
Don't be a bad sport. You got what
you wanted, and I got what I wanted.

393
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:53,624
Hey, you...

394
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:59,713
She cut off my goddamn hair.

395
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:02,007
Women.

396
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:06,094
I ain't never gettin' married.
They all turn on you.

397
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:10,224
First chance they get they're flat on
their back in bed with some other bastard.

398
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:16,688
You take JW there. He don't have to fool
around. He's got the perfect wife.

399
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:22,694
Lois is a lady, first and foremost. Quiet
and reserved, always stylishly dressed.

400
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:26,907
He never has to ask for his dinner
or hunt for clean socks.

401
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:29,910
You gotta get 'em while they're young
and take 'em right from their mama,

402
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,622
and you raise 'em up
right by you to keep 'em true.

403
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:37,125
You raise 'em just like
you would a bird dog.

404
00:48:40,212 --> 00:48:43,006
- Jerry? Is that you?
- Did I wake you, darlin'?

405
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:47,511
- I was dreamin'.
- About me?

406
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:50,305
Oh, maybe.

407
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:55,686
And that pink house with that blue door
and the little baby in that highchair.

408
00:48:57,396 --> 00:49:00,607
Quit teasin'. You're gonna
give me the sillies again.

409
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:02,526
- Myra Gale Brown.
- I gotta go.

410
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:05,404
What are you doin' callin' home
like this all the time?

411
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:06,822
Just talkin' to Myra.

412
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:09,908
Who are you talkin' to
at three o'clock in the mornin'?

413
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:13,787
- Well, what for, man?
- Cheerin' her up about her schoolwork.

414
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:17,708
It was Jerry Lee, wasn't it? Don't lie.

415
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:20,919
She don't need cheerin' up
ten times a day, now does she?

416
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:24,214
- Answer me.
- Nothin' else to do.

417
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:31,096
He's just feelin' far from home and he
wanted to hear a friendly voice is all.

418
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:37,603
- Stop or we send you to boardin' school.
- Stop or we send her to boardin' school.

419
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:45,110
"Great Balls of Fire"
is number one on the charts.

420
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:47,905
Knocked Elvis Presley's
"Teddy Bear" right off,

421
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:52,409
and remember, you heard it first
right here on WHBQ, Red Hot and Blue.

422
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:55,787
"Look" magazine called him
the other day "the wild man of rock".

423
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:57,789
Uh-huh, that's right.

424
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:01,418
This is "High School Confidential".
Everybody's dancin' to this.

425
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:02,920
Argh!

426
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:22,392
Where are we goin'?

427
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:28,690
Take a look in that glove compartment
there. I wanna show you somethin'.

428
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:33,987
It's a marriage licence.

429
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,702
I... I thought you had to stand there
and say something.

430
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:43,497
Well, it's only a permit, Myra.

431
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,709
Oh, so we ain't married?

432
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,504
Not yet.

433
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:54,508
But that's my prayer.

434
00:52:58,095 --> 00:53:00,305
I'm asking you to marry me.

435
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:02,391
Me?

436
00:53:03,308 --> 00:53:05,811
I love you.

437
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:09,398
Oh, Jerry.

438
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:17,614
Jerry, I'm only 13 years old.

439
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:21,827
Oh, heck. My sister Frankie Jean,
she was only 12 when she got married.

440
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:23,495
But...

441
00:53:27,416 --> 00:53:30,210
- But you're as old as my daddy.
- What?

442
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:32,796
Oh, hell, I ain't that old.

443
00:53:33,088 --> 00:53:37,217
- Can't we just wait three or four years?
- Well, now, I've got two hit records.

444
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:42,598
I got six months of dates booked up
in advance. I got me $100,000.

445
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:47,394
What more do you need?

446
00:53:47,603 --> 00:53:50,522
I don't know. I... Just some time to think.

447
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:53,817
Why don't you think about
that pink house with the blue door

448
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:57,988
and that blue-eyed, blond-haired
son of God comin' up the walk?

449
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,513
Do you, Myra Gale Brown,

450
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:26,600
take this man, Jerry Lee Lewis,

451
00:54:26,808 --> 00:54:29,728
to be your lawful wedded husband,

452
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:34,525
to have and to hold from this day forward,

453
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,028
till death do you part?

454
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:47,204
Oh, uh...

455
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:49,414
I do.

456
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:54,503
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

457
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:26,493
Who's gonna tell your folks?

458
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:33,292
You. You tell 'em.

459
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:36,628
No, you tell 'em.

460
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:41,216
No, Jerry. You tell 'em.

461
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:43,802
No, you tell 'em.

462
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:10,496
These potatoes are real good.

463
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:13,290
Well, thank you, Jerry Lee.

464
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,511
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

465
00:56:25,802 --> 00:56:28,305
- We can't till they know.
- When are you gonna tell 'em?

466
00:56:28,597 --> 00:56:31,725
I thought you were gonna tell 'em.

467
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:34,728
- All right. I'll tell 'em right now.
- No.

468
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:39,191
By tomorrow night, I promise.

469
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:11,390
There's some people acting
mighty funny around here.

470
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:39,001
- Will you look at this?
- Rice.

471
00:57:42,129 --> 00:57:44,298
Oh, no.

472
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,221
I knew it! They're married.

473
00:57:56,393 --> 00:58:00,314
- Jay, what are you doin'?
- I'm gonna go kill that son of a bitch.

474
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:02,191
Jay!

475
00:58:09,615 --> 00:58:11,825
- Mr Phillips?
- Hey, man!

476
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:16,330
- Son, son, son.
- Glad you could come in, Jerry.

477
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:19,416
- We just been talking about you.
- I need to talk to you, too.

478
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:22,127
Can you believe it's been almost a year

479
00:58:22,294 --> 00:58:25,130
since you first came to Sun
and cut your first record?

480
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:28,717
And we sure have come a long way
since then, ain't we?

481
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:30,427
Yes, sir.

482
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:33,013
Your new song's comin' out
in a big movie.

483
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:37,309
"High School Confidential" is gonna be
a bigger hit than "Great Balls of Fire".

484
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:39,394
Thank you, but I've got...

485
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:44,608
We got a brand-new
five-year contract to talk about.

486
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:50,823
In the spring we're gonna
be takin' that big tour to England.

487
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:54,827
- England?
- Over there, you're bigger than Elvis.

488
00:58:58,205 --> 00:59:00,207
Bigger than Elvis?

489
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:06,296
Say, don't you want JW
to read that over first?

490
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:07,714
JW?

491
00:59:07,923 --> 00:59:09,925
He's your partner, isn't he?

492
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:15,305
Well, Mr Phillips,
I've really got to tell you something.

493
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:17,808
It's...

494
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:20,018
Just a second, Jerry.

495
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:23,397
Yeah.

496
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,607
Hi, Lois.

497
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:34,324
You don't say.

498
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,328
Oh, you don't say.

499
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:41,832
Yeah. Yeah.

500
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:46,003
- Our boy just married JW's daughter.
- What?

501
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:50,215
That's what I was tryin' to say. We've
been holding back from tellin' her folks.

502
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:53,218
I told you the boy should
have had a place of his own.

503
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:59,224
It's too late now. The dam has broke loose
and there is all kinds of hell comin' down.

504
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,811
Well, I guess they didn't take it
none too good, did they?

505
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,106
JW is on his way over here now
to shoot your ass full of holes.

506
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:08,525
- We gotta get this boy outta here.
- I mean it.

507
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:13,197
And by the way, brother, next time,
let me handle the accommodations.

508
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,632
Shut up!

509
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,093
Come out, you rat bastard!

510
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:39,014
- Put the gun down. Ain't nobody here.
- Where is that son of a bitch?

511
01:00:39,431 --> 01:00:41,308
- He's gone.
- Bullshit.

512
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:44,895
Jay, come on in here
and let's talk about this thing.

513
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:48,023
There ain't a goddamn thing
to talk about, Sam.

514
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:52,194
I'm gonna kill him. I swear I will kill him.

515
01:00:52,528 --> 01:00:56,406
There are other ways
to handle this thing, man.

516
01:00:56,698 --> 01:00:59,493
Give me the gun.

517
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:02,830
All right. I'm gonna call the police.

518
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:06,625
I'll have that little shit charged
with bigamy, incest, kidnapping.

519
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:09,628
I'll put his ass away for the rest of his life.

520
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,506
Think about it for a second.

521
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:15,592
You don't know if she's gonna
have a baby or what.

522
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:20,722
A baby?

523
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:23,392
It's happened before.

524
01:01:28,105 --> 01:01:31,900
- Man, she's only 13 years old.
- You know something?

525
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:35,529
Who's to say things won't
work out between them?

526
01:01:35,821 --> 01:01:38,907
Man, I've seen this happen
a hundred times before.

527
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,326
Sometimes they'll surprise you.

528
01:01:41,618 --> 01:01:46,206
They may have a good life together.
Maybe not, but...

529
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:52,129
you're gonna have to live with
your actions for the rest of your life.

530
01:02:35,297 --> 01:02:37,299
Bye, Daddy.

531
01:03:00,197 --> 01:03:03,033
It's gonna be OK, Myra.

532
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,202
It's OK.

533
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:10,332
Hi. Hello, Lois.

534
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:15,212
Are you mad?

535
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:17,923
No, not any more.

536
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:19,925
Just hurt.

537
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:24,805
Well, I just want you to know
that I love Myra with all my heart,

538
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:27,516
and I'm gonna take real good care of her.

539
01:03:27,724 --> 01:03:30,102
Jerry, she's just a child.

540
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:34,314
Maybe in years, but not inside
where it counts. And if you're worried...

541
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:36,817
Yeah, I'm worried about my little girl.

542
01:03:37,025 --> 01:03:39,319
Well, don't.

543
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:41,697
Because she's my little girl now.

544
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:46,493
And I love her, and she loves me.

545
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:50,205
So I just hope you'll understand.

546
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:55,002
And I hope that Jay'll understand too
and stay on with the band,

547
01:03:55,294 --> 01:03:58,130
now that we're makin' all this money.

548
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:03,302
Come on, baby doll.

549
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:16,106
That's Graceland.
That's where Elvis lives.

550
01:04:17,399 --> 01:04:19,902
It's a sad day
for the women of America.

551
01:04:24,406 --> 01:04:27,910
If you hadn't already heard, Elvis Presley
was inducted into the army today.
Can't help but make a fellow wonder
who'll be the next king of rock and roll.

552
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:30,204
That's gonna be you. I know it will.

553
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:33,916
- Goodbye, Elvis.
- And you'll be my queen.

554
01:04:39,713 --> 01:04:43,425
Look, baby doll. Look right there.
Look at that. What is that?

555
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:45,594
- Oh! Jerry!
- What's that?

556
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:49,306
It's a pink house with a blue door,
that's what that is.

557
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:52,434
Just like my dollhouse!

558
01:04:57,523 --> 01:04:59,399
- Hi.
- Hello. Go on in.

559
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,901
- Hi.
- Hi.

560
01:05:02,528 --> 01:05:05,405
So this room is the foyer
and a sunken living room.

561
01:05:05,614 --> 01:05:08,826
Oh, my! The carpets, they come
with the house. So do the curtains.

562
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:14,122
Look at all the decorative trim. Over here
we have a wall, a whole wall of built-ins.

563
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:18,794
And the kitchen and the dining room. Over
here the black-and-white linoleum tile.

564
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:22,631
And the bedrooms.
Yes, you'll want to see those.

565
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:30,722
Yoo-hoo! Mr Lewis!

566
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:37,896
- Well, that's one pile. Now the other pile.
- Thanks.

567
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:41,608
Nine, ten. Be sure you date it.

568
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:51,535
Now, I want you boys to shake hands
and put your differences behind you.

569
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:56,999
I just want you to know, Jay,
she ain't pregnant.

570
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:01,128
I married her because I love her.

571
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:06,300
Now y'all are gonna be
one big happy family.

572
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:09,928
One, two, three, four.

573
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:11,508
I don't know how to be a wife.

574
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:13,802
I'm only 13 years old.

575
01:08:14,011 --> 01:08:15,596
Oh.

576
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:23,520
You're all woman to Jerry Lee, honey.

577
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:53,509
Here comes the creepy mouse.

578
01:09:38,804 --> 01:09:40,222
Ow!

579
01:09:40,514 --> 01:09:41,807
Yeah.

580
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:57,698
Where'd you learn to move like that?

581
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:03,036
I don't know. I just... I felt it in the music.

582
01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:18,510
What?

583
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:21,138
What did I do? Did I do it wrong?

584
01:10:22,097 --> 01:10:24,099
You don't move like no virgin.

585
01:11:05,307 --> 01:11:07,434
Take it.

586
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:09,728
Just go on and take it.

587
01:11:11,438 --> 01:11:14,233
Take the whole thing.

588
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:33,627
You'll come back, won't you?

589
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:36,713
I wonder if I shall.

590
01:11:36,922 --> 01:11:41,134
We must obey the creeds and codes
that we've sworn our lives to.

591
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:44,221
I know that I must not come back.

592
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:48,517
And I know that nothing
in this world can keep me away.

593
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:02,614
I'm back, baby doll.

594
01:12:02,906 --> 01:12:04,825
Oh, Jerry!

595
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:09,621
I don't care what you did before me.

596
01:12:11,206 --> 01:12:13,834
- But, Jerry, I never...
- Sh.

597
01:12:26,138 --> 01:12:29,308
30 shows in six cities in 37 days.

598
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,602
Man, we're gonna make us
a pile of money.

599
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:34,229
- Yeah.
- Yeah, how much, like, more or less?

600
01:12:34,438 --> 01:12:37,107
- Well...
- Here he comes.

601
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:40,110
The next king of rock and roll.

602
01:12:52,998 --> 01:12:56,126
- Hi, Daddy.
- What in the hell are you doin' here?

603
01:12:56,335 --> 01:13:00,130
Wherever Jerry Lee Lewis goes,
Myra Gale Lewis goes too.

604
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:05,010
Uh, Jerry, we've been going all over
the plans for your big tour to England.

605
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:07,805
- Wanna take a look?
- Ooh, I'm so excited.

606
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:10,599
- I always wanted to go to England.
- Little lady,

607
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:15,604
we don't think it might be such a good
idea if you come along on this trip.

608
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:19,107
- Why not?
- Well, the folks over there, they...

609
01:13:19,316 --> 01:13:22,736
they might not understand
about your marriage.

610
01:13:23,028 --> 01:13:25,739
You being so young, and all.

611
01:13:27,616 --> 01:13:30,327
We'll just say she's 15.
That'll be all right, won't it?

612
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:31,411
No.

613
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:35,207
The papers over there are saying you
could be the next king of rock and roll.

614
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:38,335
- But you gotta act accordingly.
- Yeah.

615
01:13:39,628 --> 01:13:43,006
- It ain't fair. I wanna go.
- You're my daughter, and you ain't goin'.

616
01:13:43,215 --> 01:13:45,300
She's my wife,

617
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:48,637
and I say she is goin'.

618
01:13:57,938 --> 01:14:01,316
If Myra ain't goin', I ain't goin' neither.

619
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:24,131
It's all right, ma'am. She's my wife.

620
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:29,303
Well, maybe if someone got me a weddin'
ring people wouldn't do us thataway.

621
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,639
- I'm going back to talk to Mama.
- Hey, smell that.

622
01:14:36,435 --> 01:14:41,440
Baby doll, I'm gonna buy you the finest
weddin' ring in all of London, England.

623
01:14:47,404 --> 01:14:49,406
I hate covering arrivals.

624
01:14:49,615 --> 01:14:51,909
I didn't hear you complain
when it was Liberace.

625
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:56,330
Oh, look here. You're not suggesting
that an artiste of Liberace's stature

626
01:14:56,622 --> 01:15:00,918
can be likened to the boogie-woogie
of a gum-chewing country bumpkin?

627
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,212
Well, hello.

628
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:09,801
Look at him, sport! He's the new king
of rock and roll. Mr Lewis! Mr Lewis!

629
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:13,806
- Do you intend to record here?
- You stay right there.

630
01:15:14,014 --> 01:15:16,016
Are you gonna meet your British fans?

631
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:18,811
How will British youngsters
respond to your music?

632
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:21,438
Just point me at a piano
and in 15 minutes

633
01:15:21,605 --> 01:15:25,400
I'll have 'em shoutin' and a-shakin'
and a-shiverin' and a-shackin'.

634
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:28,612
What about that long hair
of yours, Mr Lewis?

635
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:34,034
Well, my killer wavy blond hair? It's just
so pretty I can't bring myself to cut it.

636
01:15:34,409 --> 01:15:37,621
What cities are you playing in, Mr Lewis?

637
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:40,624
How long will you be
touring for, Mr Lewis?

638
01:15:44,419 --> 01:15:47,631
Excuse me, Miss.
Are you related to Mr Lewis?

639
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,133
I'm Frankie Jean, Jerry Lee's sister.

640
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:52,803
Oh, yes. And what about you, Miss?

641
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:55,430
Um, I'm his wife.

642
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:57,724
I beg your pardon. I didn't catch that.

643
01:15:57,933 --> 01:16:00,227
I'm Mrs Jerry Lee Lewis.

644
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,105
Mr Lewis.

645
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:06,900
Is it true that you're married to this... girl?

646
01:16:13,407 --> 01:16:16,410
Yes, I am. And proud of it.

647
01:16:16,702 --> 01:16:20,122
This is my little bride, Myra Gale Lewis.

648
01:16:20,539 --> 01:16:22,624
- But she looks so young.
- How old is she?

649
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:24,626
Uh, she's 15.

650
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:26,712
- 15!
- Did he say 15?

651
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:30,132
15 years old? Isn't that
a bit young to be a wife?

652
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:34,219
Gosh, no. Back home, people get married
at ten. One girl got wed at nine.

653
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:36,305
- Married at ten?
- Wed at nine?

654
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:39,141
- How could you?
- I love her.

655
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:41,602
But she's only a baby.

656
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:50,027
Hello, Jerry!

657
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:55,616
Yesterday, Britons
were shocked to discover

658
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:59,912
that visiting American rock-and-roll
star Mr Jerry Lee Lewis

659
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:02,706
was married to a 15-year-old girl.

660
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:06,835
- Looky there! My baby's famous.
- Well, brace yourself, England.

661
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:11,715
The child bride in question
is 13 years of age,

662
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:14,426
and furthermore, she's his cousin.

663
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:17,429
Second cousin twice removed.

664
01:17:18,222 --> 01:17:20,933
You're on every front page in England.

665
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:27,815
"Child bride is so young. "

666
01:17:28,732 --> 01:17:31,026
I begged you to keep your big mouth shut.

667
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:33,904
A few pictures of Myra ain't no big deal.

668
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:39,117
Jerry, this is a big deal.
I mean, will you listen to this guy?

669
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:44,623
Let's show Mr Lewis what we think of him
and his baby-snatching ways.

670
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:49,211
Hell, Mr Phillips, we've got
nothin' to be ashamed of.

671
01:17:51,839 --> 01:17:53,841
The moment you're waiting for,

672
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:58,637
that fabulous rock-and-roll sensation
from the US of A, Jerry Lee Lewis.

673
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:03,016
Hello, England. How are y'all doin'?

674
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:30,002
Y'all don't have to just sit there quiet,
you know. This is a rock-and-roll session.

675
01:18:30,335 --> 01:18:33,422
Y'all can let your hair down.
It'll be all right.

676
01:18:44,016 --> 01:18:46,602
It's awful quiet out there.

677
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:50,230
I hope y'all aren't as dead
as you sound. I'm alive.

678
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:18,425
- Sissy!
- Queer!

679
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:20,803
- Put a lid on it.
- Jerry!

680
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:23,639
- Cradle robber!
- Baby snatcher!

681
01:19:23,806 --> 01:19:27,017
- Jerry, just play.
- I got married before God.

682
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:29,228
- Oh, get out of it!
- Get on your bike!

683
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:32,940
And what's between me and Myra
is between us and God.

684
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:36,610
And everybody else can just
mind their own business.

685
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:39,404
- Go back to America!
- Get off!

686
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:27,035
Get lost!

687
01:21:32,935 --> 01:21:35,521
- How was the concert?
- Great.

688
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:40,609
Did all those English girls
try to rip your clothes off?

689
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,117
"Police to act in case of child bride. "

690
01:21:49,326 --> 01:21:51,537
"Home Office to investigate. "

691
01:21:51,829 --> 01:21:53,831
Good morning.

692
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:56,416
- Investigate what?
- They call you a bigamist.

693
01:21:56,708 --> 01:22:00,629
They found out you weren't divorced from
your second wife when you married Myra.

694
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:02,714
You mean we ain't married?

695
01:22:03,006 --> 01:22:06,009
I never was married to my second wife
in the first place.

696
01:22:06,218 --> 01:22:08,804
I already told you
I didn't need to get a divorce.

697
01:22:09,138 --> 01:22:11,306
Yeah. Um, take a look down there.

698
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,815
We're under siege.
They don't want us here.

699
01:22:23,735 --> 01:22:26,613
- Hello.
- May we see your passports?

700
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:29,825
Uh, yes. Yeah.
Right over here. Just a second.

701
01:22:32,411 --> 01:22:35,330
- Why don't they just go away?
- They're just curious.

702
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:37,708
They wanna see the new king.

703
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:42,004
Don't you understand?
They're angry with you because of me.

704
01:22:42,337 --> 01:22:44,214
Don't let that bother you, baby doll.

705
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:47,509
You're just going to have
to get used to being my queen.

706
01:22:47,718 --> 01:22:49,720
What do you mean? But...

707
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:52,431
You gotta give the boy a chance now.

708
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:56,810
The promoters have cancelled the tour.

709
01:22:57,144 --> 01:22:59,438
The government is tryin' to deport you.

710
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:02,316
We're washed up here, kids.
We're gettin' out.

711
01:23:02,524 --> 01:23:05,611
Oh, Mama. I wanna go home.

712
01:23:06,028 --> 01:23:08,322
Well, what if I don't wanna go?

713
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:10,532
Well, why would you wanna stay?

714
01:23:10,741 --> 01:23:13,535
I promised Myra
I'd buy her a weddin' ring.

715
01:23:13,744 --> 01:23:17,831
Well, what do I need a ring for
if we ain't even married?

716
01:23:18,832 --> 01:23:21,335
- Put him in jail!
- Where's Jerry, then?

717
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:24,421
- They're coming out!
- Oi, mate! Where's Jerry?

718
01:23:35,224 --> 01:23:36,517
It's him!

719
01:23:36,642 --> 01:23:38,727
It's Jerry Lee and Myra!

720
01:23:39,019 --> 01:23:40,938
Come on!

721
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:46,735
My God!

722
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:53,242
Did I do this? This is all my fault.

723
01:24:02,334 --> 01:24:04,336
I've ruined your career.

724
01:24:04,545 --> 01:24:07,840
You never should have married me.
Everything was fine until me.

725
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:10,008
Myra? Baby doll?

726
01:24:11,009 --> 01:24:13,011
You're my wife and I love you,

727
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:16,932
and I'll marry you a hundred times
to prove it if I have to.

728
01:24:35,325 --> 01:24:38,245
- What do you think of your "king" now?
- You're right.

729
01:24:38,537 --> 01:24:40,831
- Elvis Presley is the true king.
- What was that?

730
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:44,710
He said Mr Presley is
the true king of rock and roll.

731
01:24:44,918 --> 01:24:48,505
Y'all would have lost the war
without us. You just think about that.

732
01:24:48,839 --> 01:24:52,342
Do you think your expulsion from England
is a repudiation of rock and roll?

733
01:24:52,509 --> 01:24:57,639
They cancelled Jerry Lee's tour because
of our marriage, not cos of his music.

734
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,809
We've been beat up pretty bad
because of this publicity,

735
01:25:01,018 --> 01:25:04,229
but Myra and I love each other,
and we mean to keep it that way.

736
01:25:04,438 --> 01:25:08,442
Jerry, looking ahead, don't you think your
popularity will be diminished at home?

737
01:25:08,817 --> 01:25:11,945
Back home they take a different view
of this sort of a thing.

738
01:25:12,112 --> 01:25:14,823
I expect a great reception
when I get back there.

739
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,534
My fans'll understand.

740
01:25:22,039 --> 01:25:25,918
Mr Lewis, do you have
any final words for England?

741
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:28,545
Yeah.

742
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,839
England can kiss my ass.

743
01:26:29,106 --> 01:26:30,732
They had a double-ring ceremony -
a wedding ring and a teething ring.

744
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:35,028
You've heard of sack dresses?
Myra wears sack diapers.

745
01:26:35,737 --> 01:26:39,116
She can't go to see her husband's show -
her bedtime is 8.30.

746
01:26:40,033 --> 01:26:43,412
Myra.

747
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:08,729
Mr Phillips! What's this all about?

748
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:17,946
Uh...

749
01:27:21,325 --> 01:27:26,246
Jerry, we were thinkin'
that maybe it would be a good idea

750
01:27:26,622 --> 01:27:29,124
if we took out a full-page ad...

751
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:33,545
- In Billboard.
- In Billboard.

752
01:27:33,837 --> 01:27:36,006
Uh, sort of a...

753
01:27:36,215 --> 01:27:38,509
An apology.

754
01:27:40,427 --> 01:27:44,932
It might get your phone
to start ringin' again.

755
01:27:48,018 --> 01:27:50,646
Who are you people?

756
01:27:52,022 --> 01:27:55,943
Who are you to walk into my house
and tell me to apologise?

757
01:27:57,027 --> 01:27:59,947
You're makin' more off me
than you ever made off Elvis.

758
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:04,034
- Jerry Lee, I don't think...
- What, are you in on this too? Huh?

759
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:09,915
I see that you are.

760
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:14,336
You all want Jerry Lee
just to get down on his knees

761
01:28:14,545 --> 01:28:18,006
so you can go on gettin'
your little piece of him?

762
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:23,428
Dogs. You're all a bunch
of snappin' dogs at my heel.

763
01:28:24,721 --> 01:28:28,308
You see this hand?
It makes $5,000 a night.

764
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:33,230
You see this one? It does too.
$10,000 a night I've made.

765
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:37,734
Man, I am Jerry Lee Lewis!

766
01:28:37,943 --> 01:28:41,530
I am the goddamn king!
I have a God-given talent!

767
01:28:44,825 --> 01:28:47,411
I shine like gold when I play that piano.

768
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:52,416
And you want me

769
01:28:53,834 --> 01:28:55,210
to bend my knee?

770
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:01,008
And what the hell I got to apologise for?

771
01:29:02,843 --> 01:29:05,429
I married the girl I love.

772
01:29:05,637 --> 01:29:08,223
I married her twice.

773
01:29:08,932 --> 01:29:11,727
And I sang and I played my guts out!

774
01:29:17,316 --> 01:29:19,610
I shine like gold.

775
01:29:22,237 --> 01:29:24,740
Don't you tell me to apologise.

776
01:29:26,742 --> 01:29:30,120
Your telephone hasn't been ringing, Jerry.

777
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:36,210
If you sign this, it may well start.

778
01:31:18,228 --> 01:31:19,646
- I quit.
- Jay.

779
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:22,024
I quit.

780
01:31:36,538 --> 01:31:39,833
Jerry, why do you do it? Don't!

781
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:43,420
Will you tell me who the hell is there?!

782
01:32:52,114 --> 01:32:54,741
Come here. Come here.

783
01:32:56,034 --> 01:32:58,537
- Don't you like it?
- Stop!

784
01:33:54,635 --> 01:33:57,429
Do you believe I'm sorry?

785
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:02,434
I am.

786
01:34:02,643 --> 01:34:04,645
My hand to God.

787
01:34:09,024 --> 01:34:12,736
Well... you know, you can't
hit me no more, Jerry.

788
01:34:13,028 --> 01:34:16,031
I just said I was sorry, didn't I?

789
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:20,327
- Yeah, but that ain't what I mean.
- I know what you mean.

790
01:34:20,619 --> 01:34:22,538
You won't let me forget this, will you?

791
01:34:22,746 --> 01:34:26,250
- No, Jerry, that ain't it at all.
- Oh, yes, it is.

792
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:29,837
What, you think you're the only one
that gets hit around here?

793
01:34:30,129 --> 01:34:32,422
- You don't think I get hit?
- Please listen to me.

794
01:34:32,631 --> 01:34:34,633
You don't think there ain't a day goes by

795
01:34:34,925 --> 01:34:39,638
that I don't get smacked by some thieving
promoter or chicken-livered disc jockey or lyin' reporter?

796
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:42,432
Jerry, I've got somethin' to tell you!

797
01:34:42,724 --> 01:34:45,811
- This is the thanks I get?
- Jerry, I'm having a baby!

798
01:34:46,145 --> 01:34:48,814
I'm having a baby!

799
01:35:09,418 --> 01:35:11,628
I want to tell you a story.

800
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:16,216
A story about... two cousins.

801
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,639
Closer than brothers,

802
01:35:22,931 --> 01:35:26,810
who came upon two roads that diverged.

803
01:35:28,145 --> 01:35:30,939
Now, one took the dirt path.

804
01:35:31,648 --> 01:35:34,151
The less-travelled way.

805
01:35:34,318 --> 01:35:39,031
Serving the Lord for the reward
that waits in heaven.

806
01:35:42,242 --> 01:35:45,412
The other started down the wide street,

807
01:35:46,246 --> 01:35:48,540
paved with gold,

808
01:35:48,749 --> 01:35:54,838
hypnotising millions of disciples
in the sin that is the devil's music.

809
01:35:56,632 --> 01:35:59,426
Rock and roll is like a painted woman.

810
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,348
And he could not resist her charms.

811
01:36:05,224 --> 01:36:08,352
Along the way he married and divorced.

812
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:12,439
Married and divorced again!

813
01:36:12,731 --> 01:36:17,736
Married a third time...
to his 13-year-old cousin!

815
01:36:19,029 --> 01:36:21,740
The whole world was appalled...

816
01:36:23,742 --> 01:36:27,037
because he had sinned against the Lord

819
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:30,332
Nor walked in his laws!

820
01:36:30,624 --> 01:36:34,920
Nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies.

822
01:36:35,212 --> 01:36:39,049
Therefore is this land
become a desolation,

821
01:36:35,212 --> 01:36:39,049
and an astonishment, and a curse.

813
01:36:11,513 --> 01:36:17,429
Many are those that say of his soul
there is no salvage for him in God.

813
01:36:11,513 --> 01:36:17,429
No, not true

814
01:36:18,633 --> 01:36:23,184
But I say that anyone who is ready
to accept Jesus Christ into their life -

817
01:36:24,233 --> 01:36:27,270
let him come forward and be saved!

818
01:36:27,953 --> 01:36:33,027
Is there anyone here today ready
to accept Jesus Christ into their life?



823
01:36:35,993 --> 01:36:41,590
Grab hold of that nail-scarred hand
and take a walk toward glory!

824
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:47,028
Hallelujah! Come on up here, sister.

825
01:36:47,553 --> 01:36:50,545
Hallelujah! God loves you.

826
01:36:50,673 --> 01:36:53,551
Devil, you gonna get a black eye today!

827
01:36:55,513 --> 01:36:59,267
Praise Jesus! Are you ready
to accept Jesus Christ into your life?

828
01:36:59,393 --> 01:37:01,987
- Are you ready to accept Christ?
- Yes!

829
01:37:02,113 --> 01:37:04,866
Rapture her up, Lord! Hallelujah!

830
01:37:08,513 --> 01:37:11,311
Cousin, do you still have
that coin I gave you?

831
01:37:14,873 --> 01:37:17,023
I've got it, cousin.

832
01:37:17,153 --> 01:37:20,509
Cousin, the time has come
for you to choose.

833
01:37:22,033 --> 01:37:25,867
Will you choose the gold-paved road
of the devil?

834
01:37:28,273 --> 01:37:30,184
Or the rocky path of the Lord?

835
01:37:38,913 --> 01:37:41,302
Cousin, my road was paved
a long time ago

836
01:37:41,433 --> 01:37:44,584
and there ain't nothin' I can do about it.

837
01:37:45,233 --> 01:37:47,793
Lord, help him.

838
01:37:53,953 --> 01:37:55,944
So if I'm goin' to hell...

839
01:37:56,073 --> 01:37:58,268
I'm goin' there playin' the piano.

840
01:38:13,033 --> 01:38:13,988
Jerry!

841
01:38:20,593 --> 01:38:27,510
I love you, Jerry.

842
01:38:27,633 --> 01:38:31,626
Steve Allen Lewis was born
February 27, 1959

842
01:38:27,633 --> 01:38:31,626
Jerry Lee Lewis is 
playing his heart out somewhere in America tonight

843
01:40:57,473 --> 01:40:59,225
Jerry! Jerry!
